# MSKT
the code of "MSKT: A Mode Switching Knowledge Tracing Framework for Modeling Studentsâ€™ Stepwise Development"

We temporarily provide the dataset "college physics", which can be found in "data\new_college_physics.csv" (you need to unzip the folder first). The dataset file has been preprocessed, including rearrange ID numbers and calculating the ideal scores within one exam done by each student.

You can run "train.ipynb" to train the model.
